# Using **BrainSight** #

With a series of tutorials we demonstrate how the data management and processing functionality of [Kelvin](https://machinemedicine.com/kelvin/) can be leveraged by BrainSight to produce robust analysis of the local field potentials data at scale.

Using real code examples we will explore the key functionality of BrainSight:

1. **Signal Preprocessing**: Functions to filter and clean LFP signals, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.
2. **Frequency Analysis**: Tools to extract and analyze beta band oscillations, allowing detailed examination of neural activity patterns.
3. **Region Comparison**: Methods to compare LFP characteristics within motor regions versus non-motor regions, highlighting functional differences.
4. **Visualization**: Comprehensive plotting utilities to visualize LFP signals, power spectra, and spatial distribution of neural activity.
