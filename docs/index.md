# Welcome to **BrainSight** #

## What is it? ##

**BrainSight** is a python-based toolkit that simplifies the analysis of
[KELVIN](https://machinemedicine.com/kelvin/)-created multimodal datasets
containing kinematic and brain-sensing data captured during a motor assessment.

These modalities include, among others:

- Local field potential (LFP) signals,
- Pose estimation data,
- Automatically detected activity regions.

Full description of the dataset creation can be found [here](dataset.md).
